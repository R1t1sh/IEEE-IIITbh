        IIIT Bhubaneswar owes its origins to the initiative of the Government of
        Odisha. It is a result of the desire of the Government to establish a
        world-class institute of Information Technology in the state. The
        institute has been registered as a society in November 2006. In January
        2014, the institute is converted to a University by the Government of
        Odisha. There is misconception that IIIT Bhubaneswar is an institute
        promoted in PPP mode by the Government. The institute is fully owned by
        the Government of Odisha. The Information Technology Department is the
        controlling Department. The government provides funds for the
        Infrastructure creation. However, the institute has to earn its Revenue
        Expenditure. This is the model in all State Government promoted IIITs in
        Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi. The institute enjoys academic,
        financial, and administrative autonomy by the powers invested through
        the IIIT Bhubaneswar Act. IIIT aspires to be a national institute in
        line with its Peer institutes. The Governance structure of the institute
        is modeled after those of the IITs. The Governor of the state is the
        Chancellor of the institute. The Board of Governors has members from the
        Odisha Legislative Assembly, the Government of Odisha, Leaders from the
        IT industry, and Eminent educationists. Currently, the Chairman of the
        institute is the Chief Secretary of the Government of Odisha. The
        Director is the Executive Head of the institute. The Director is
        assisted by the Registrar, the Deans, the controller of examinations,
        and the controller of finance in the day-to-day management of the
        institute. The institute has its focus on quality and rigorous
        education, quality resources, academic infrastructure, technology, and
        innovation. These initiatives have helped IIIT-Bhubaneswar achieve
        pre-eminence in India and beyond.
